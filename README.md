# NKNK
NKNK is a Terminal made with 100% python. Its configurable through a yaml file. And theres a install script to configure it with a tui. Whys it a terminal and not a shell? Because nknk is dependant on another shell, of your choice obviously. If you want to use truely 100% python, I recommend using xonsh as you nknk shell.

# install
`curl -o install.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marufromhell/NKNK/main/install.py && python3 install.py`
