# NKNK
NKNK is a Terminal made with 100% python. You can easily use it like python repl. And it has git integration. Its configurable through a yaml file. And theres a install script to configure it with a tui.  
  
Whys it a terminal and not a shell? Because nknk is dependant on another shell, of your choice obviously. If you want to use truely 100% python, I recommend using xonsh as you nknk shell.  

But isn't python slow? Not really in this case. NKNK isnt slow at all, sometimes it feels more responsive than zsh or bash when configured with themes.

Future plans:  
zoxide support.  

# install
`curl -o install.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marufromhell/NKNK/main/install.py && python3 install.py`
