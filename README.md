# NKNK
NKNK is a project to make a cli in *mostly* python, also depending on other projects made in *mostly* python like xonsh.
NKNK is a recursive acronym for NK's not KSL.
Ksl (Knife Sharp Library) was a library for K#(Knife sharp).
KSL was never finished, but shortly before it ended, it had a final commit for, a selector menu, developer testing selection program, and a CLI.
NKNK is a improved version of the KSL.CMDLINE that is easily hackable. Every part of NKNK is hackable, due to it all being written in python.

Currently NKNK is more like a terminal, because it doesnt run the commands directly, but it is extremely convenient sometimes for things such as making shortcut commands. 

#The new command completion is sick


Put the files in ~/prog/nknk
Change ~ or $HOMEDIR to your home directory
run install.sh
run nksh in your terminal to run nknk
